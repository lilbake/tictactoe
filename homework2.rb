#test to show the array contains 6 lots of “Greene County”
#test that there are 6 elements with the value “Greene County” #in the array
#add any other tests that you can think of to demonstrate that #the code works as you think


# starting from scratch (new files),
# build a function that returns an array containing the numbers 1 to 100, 
# where any number divisible by 3 is replaced by “greene”,
#  any number divisible by 5 is replaced by “county”, 
#  and any number divisible by both 3 and 5 is replaced by “greene county”.
#   Write tests to demonstrate that your function behaves correctly. Try to write a test first,
#   then write the code to make it pass, 
#and build up the function this way.
